# Odin Http Client
This library provides a lightweight http client written purely in Odin. The client is inspired by https://github.com/reagent/http.

## Installation
```
odin build http -build-mode:dll -out:build/http.dll
```

## Example

## Warning
No guarantees are made regarding spec adherence and features. I only supported what was needed to make http requests for my purposes.
